    "helpbuttonsDescription": "Helpbuttons is the open-source software that powers this application. With Helpbuttons, you can create your own networks to share food, housing, transportation, or anything else you have in mind, and then federate with other networks to share users and resources. Helpbuttons specializes in connecting people who do not yet know each other for various purposes in the real world.",
    "forDescription": "Our goal is to foster a cohesive society, promote cooperation, and optimize the design of collaborative tools to fully leverage the advantages of the internet applied to real life. We are aware of the amounts of money and time required each time a new collaborative application is launched. Most of these tools share a significant portion of their basic functionalities, and we believe these similarities could be harnessed to create a modular system that serves many cases and saves resources.",
    "helpbuttonDescription": "A Helpbutton or Button refers to a post. Each post made by a user on Helpbuttons is called a Helpbutton. Helpbuttons can represent offers, needs, exchanges, transportation proposals, business ideas, etc. They can also be renamed to suit the specific needs of your application.",
    "communityDescription": "Helpbuttons or Botonesdeayuda is designed by independent programmers from Spain and Portugal, mainly with selfless contributions in their free time. Currently, the project is in the process of seeking funding to sustain its maintenance for the general public. These programmers, along with the user community that starts using the tool, form the community that the project needs to sustain itself against other traditional application models. Later on, by federating with other Helpbuttons/Botonesdeayuda applications, we will be able to share users and resources. This method of collaboration allows us to bring more people together and ultimately improve the tool we provide. The legal representative acting as the interlocutor with the administration is the non-profit association 'Watch Out, Freedom!' G67992032, avda Mexico 10, Jerez, CÃ¡diz (Spain) tl:+34680936011",
    "networksEthicsDescription": "{0} is a Network created with Helpbuttons technology. The Network administrators are responsible for moderating the content published and complying with the ethical and legal standards of the area where their Network is developed. Contact them through the contact options that appear in the Moderators section on the Home page. The programmers of this platform cannot be held responsible for the content or purposes for which this tool may be used outside of our servers.",
    "ethicsDescription": "This project seeks to enhance the autonomy of individuals and communities to cooperate. Our three principles are: Freedom, inclusion, and decentralization. 1. Freedom to use the tool and share it for multiple purposes. 2. Inclusion to accommodate those less familiar with technologies through responsible design, addressing real-life needs. 3. Decentralization to allow multiple degrees of shared responsibility in data usage: From collective (servers) to individual (anonymous keys). If using our servers, anything aligned with these values is welcome and will have total freedom. We believe in transparency, honesty, and respect for all people. While we cannot control the use of our software on other servers, we will not allow behavior that goes against human integrity and dignity, or that promotes animal abuse. Our software is designed to connect people and facilitate exchange, a responsibility we take seriously. We encourage our users to use the platform and any replicas they make with the same values in mind, prioritizing respectful communication and conscious exchange. Any misuse of the software on our servers, including exploitation, harming others, or manipulating platform functionalities for personal gain, will not be tolerated.",
    "privacyDescription": "We work every day to find better solutions for data privacy in Networks created with Helpbuttons. We value the right to anonymity and offer the possibility for people to participate both anonymously and with personal data. Helpbuttons is designed to NEVER use users' personal data for commercial purposes or personal interests of any user group. We also offer the possibility to completely delete your data easily and transparently. We are transparent about our data collection processes, and you have the right to access, update, or delete your personal data at any time. Remember that sharing personal information in Helpbuttons posts is at your discretion; be aware and share only what you feel comfortable sharing with others. Note that the Network administrator is responsible for handling your data, do not share sensitive data if you do not trust that administrator. Please direct your questions to the following email: help@helpbuttons.org",
    "securityDescription": "Every day we incorporate new security improvements in the Networks, through joint work with the open-source community we are analyzing and preparing security tools for users without IT knowledge to use them. If you believe there is a security issue related to the use of the Network, contact the administrator through the Home page. If you think there may be a cybersecurity breach that jeopardizes the integrity of our software and the safety of our users, write to help@helpbuttons.org. We continuously update and review our systems to ensure they meet the highest cybersecurity standards. However, we also believe that security is a shared responsibility. If you have installed this tool on your server, we encourage you to practice safe online behaviors, such as using strong passwords and protecting personal information. Please direct your questions to the following email: help@helpbuttons.org",
    "contactDescription": "If you want to communicate with the site managers, go to the Home section. If you want to contact the programmers who make the app possible, please direct your questions to the following email: help@helpbuttons.org"
