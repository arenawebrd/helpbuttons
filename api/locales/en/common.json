    "forDescription": "We aim to foster a cohesive society, promote cooperation, and optimize the design of collaborative tools in order to fully leverage the advantages of the internet. In brief, we've observed the substantial amounts of money, time, and user participation required each time a new collaborative app is launched. This seems unnecessary. Most of these tools share a significant portion of their core functionalities. We believe these commonalities could be managed using the same software, simply adapted for each unique purpose through various modules.",
    "helpbuttonDescription": "A _helpbutton_ refers to a post. Every post published by a user in _helpbuttons_ is termed a _helpbutton_. _helpbuttons_ can represent offers, needs, exchanges, transport proposals, businesses, and so forth. They can also be renamed to suit the specific needs of your app.",
    "communityDescription": "The _helpbuttons_ community is the backbone of this project, providing it with sustainability. This tool is designed for adaptability to a multitude of purposes, thereby benefitting a diverse range of users while also encouraging support for the project. By federating with other _helpbuttons_ apps, you can share users and resources. This method of collaboration enables us to unite more people and ultimately improve the tool we provide.",

Our software is designed to connect people and facilitate sharing, which is a responsibility we take seriously.
